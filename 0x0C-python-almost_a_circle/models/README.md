## Welcome to a Simple Python Learning Journey

Hello there! This project is a humble part of my learning experience at ALX Africa for Software Engineering. We'll be exploring the basics of Python by working on rectangles and squaresâ€”simple, yet meaningful steps on this coding adventure.

### About Me
- **Name:** Mounim Nadir
- **Role:** Aspiring Python Developer at ALX Africa

### Project Structure
This endeavor is structured with simplicity in mind:

- **base.py:** Here, the `Base` class handles the IDs of instances.
- **rectangle.py:** A step into rectangles with the `Rectangle` class, a subclass of `Base`.
- **square.py:** Further simplicity with the `Square` class, a noble subclass of `Rectangle`.
- **tests/:** A space for tests, ensuring our code meets its modest goals.

## Getting Started
Feel free to clone this repository, wander through the code, and explore the realm of Pythonic shapes. The `tests/` directory holds tests for assurance.

May your coding journey be smooth and filled with small victories!
